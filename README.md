## How to install

### Using Git (recommended)

1.  Clone the project from github. Change "myproject" to your project name.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saajan/node-api-boilerplate.git ./myproject
```

### Install npm dependencies after installing (Git or manual download)

```bash
cd myproject
npm install
```

### Setting up environments

1.  You will find a file named `.env.example` on root directory of project.
2.  Create a new file by copying and pasting the file and then renaming it to just `.env`
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
3.  The file `.env` is already ignored, so you never commit your credentials.
4.  Change the values of the file to your environment. Helpful comments added to `.env.example` file to understand the constants.

## How to run

### Running  API server locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

You will know server is running by checking the output of the command `npm run dev`

```bash
Connected to mongodb:YOUR_DB_CONNECTION_STRING
App is running ...

Press CTRL + C to stop the process.
```
**Note:**  `YOUR_DB_CONNECTION_STRING` will be your MongoDB connection string.

### Creating new models

If you need to add more models to the project just create a new file in `/models/` and use them in the controllers.

### Creating new routes

npm test
```

You can set custom command for test at `package.json` file inside `scripts` property. You can also change timeout for each assertion with `--timeout` parameter of mocha command.

### Creating new tests

If you need to add more test cases to the project just create a new file in `/test/` and run the command.
